While the competition itself was a success, it had results beyond what we imagined. It showed us that it was not just a competition, but a transformative force that could lead to a drought-free Maharashtra. Watch the story of the first Water Cup here. (Duration 43:15 min) </h5>

That’s the effect of the Water Cup 2017 in which over 1,300 villages took part. The journey of the second Water Cup is documented in this video. (Duration 9:56 min) </h5>

          <p style="text-align:justify; padding: 5px">The TV show Satyamev Jayate taught us that communication can mobilise people into action, and people themselves are a force that can change circumstance. Enthused by this we thought that if we work on one specific issue and stay with it for a consistent period of time, then perhaps we could be part of a massive social transformation. The issue we chose was water. Large parts of rural Maharashtra are afflicted every year with drought, badly affecting thousands of villages and crippling every aspect of social life. Maharashtra has 43,665 villages divided in 355 talukas. We found that wherever the issue had been solved in villages like Hiware Bazar, Ralegan Siddhi, Hivre, among others – the solution lay in people’s collective efforts and labour. So, Paani Foundation was conceived to work with people across the spectrum using our skills as communicators to empower and mobilise people to work together to fight drought. In the first year we worked in 3 talukas, in the second year we worked in 30 talukas. We have now embarked on the third year of the Water Cup and worked in 75 talukas. I invite you to join in this endeavour, and make it a water revolution.
